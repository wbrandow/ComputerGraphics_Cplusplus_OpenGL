# ComputerGraphics_Cpp_OpenGL
Computer graphics example code written in C++ using OpenGL

# Purpose
This code was written in CS-330, a computer graphics course focused on OpenGL, a C++ library.  This program renders a pencil on a table top.  A screenshot has also been included, CS-330_pencil.jpg.

# Additional libraries
All code in this repository was written by William Brandow.  Additional libraries required for the execution of this code are as follows:
 - GLFW (version 3.3.8) - glfw.org
 - GLEW (version 7.0) - glew.sourceforge.net
 - GLM - github.com/g-truc/glm
 - stb_image - github.com/nothings/stb
 
 # Future Development
 Work on this code is still ongoing.  As part of this project several more objects will be added.  In the future, I would like to finish the table as well and make an 
 entire room.  I will also add additional light sources such as windows and lamps.
