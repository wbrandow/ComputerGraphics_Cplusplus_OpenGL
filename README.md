# ComputerGraphics_Cpp_OpenGL
Computer graphics example code written in C++ using OpenGL

# Purpose
This code was written in CS-330, a computer graphics course focused on OpenGL, an industry standard for C++ graphics libraries.  This program renders a pencil on a table top.  A screenshot has also been included, CS-330_pencil.jpg.

# Additional Libraries
All code in this repository was written by William Brandow.  Additional libraries required for the execution of this code are as follows:
 - GLFW (version 3.3.8) - glfw.org
 - GLEW (version 7.0) - glew.sourceforge.net
 - GLM - github.com/g-truc/glm
 - stb_image - github.com/nothings/stb
 
 # Lessons Learned
 This project involved more than getting good practice with C++ and some very useful graphics libraries.  This was an excellent trigonometry and linear algebra refresher.  It was also good to get practice in Visual Studio IDE.
 
 # Future Development
 Work on this code is still ongoing.  As part of this project several more objects will be added.  I will add several more methods to Shape.cpp for shapes, such as, tori, and spheres.   In the future, I would like to finish the table as well and make an entire room.  I will also add additional light sources such as windows and lamps.  
 
 From a code maintenance standpoint, I would like to move input processing functions into their own .cpp file.  This will make the code easier to read and understand.  It will also ensure easy reuse of common input processing methods for other projects.
